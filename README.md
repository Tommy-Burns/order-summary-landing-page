### What I learned

As a newbie to FrontEnd Development, I learnt a lot of new things and I'm very happy I took this challenge.

```html
<h1>A big THANK YOU TO Frontend Mentor</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-frontend-mentor {
  color: gold;
}
```
```js
const proud_Of_Myself = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development
I look forward to taking more challnges of even higher difficulty levels and learn more powerful frameworks like  React.JS and all other frameworks and tools that will make me a seasoned developer.
